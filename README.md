### Purpose of this pack

* Prepare CV document, which is ready to print in few languages.
* Modern, but modest layout
* Automation

### Pack stucture
Pack is devided into 3 parts:
1. **Matter**:  includes CV contents
2. **Packages**: includes CV class macros
3. **Settings**: include CV settings like section definitions, icons, etc

(4. *main.tex*: main file to compile)

(5. *CV.cls*: CV document *LaTeX* class)


### How to use it?
##### Swaping between languages
One can select language by setting class option (in `main.tex`):
```
\documentclass[english]{CV}
```
To change language to polish just change english into polish:
```
\documentclass[polish]{CV}
```
##### Default sections, fields and other settings
Provided class contains pre-defined sections (e.g. `\publications`) and fields (e.g. `\phone{}`) with coresponding icons.

###### Personal data section
Personal data section includes many pre-defined fields, which user can easly disable. 
When you do not want to print your phone number, just set empty field by: `\phone{}` (by default all contact informations are present in `Matter/contact.tex`).
To change the order of fields in `Personal Data` section just go to `Settings/FillContactOrder.sty`.

###### Default sections
There are several different pre-defined sections, which can be set by `\<sectionname>` for example `\publications`.
To change section name in selected language go to: `Setting/LANG/...` and just edit the `\def\<sectionname>Name{Section Name}` macro.

###### CV item
In most CV documents one should show experience, education and etc.  over the years.
This CV class provide `\timeitem[ <Details> ]{ <What?> }{ <When?> }` macro, which take care of some your history record.
Example:
`\time[Middle-earth studies, bachelor studies, thesis: \textit{History of Hobbits}]{University of Shire}{2013 -- 2015}`
Output:
[![timeitem](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andywiecko/MultiLangCV/master/examples/timeitem.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andywiecko/MultiLangCV/master/examples/timeitem.png)

###### Image
By default image height is controlled by number of non-zero fields in `\personaldata` section.
To override this add aditional argument to `\image[ <height in number of rows> ]{ <image file> }`.

###### Quotations
Quotation markings are different in many languages. 
By default this class load `csquotes` packages with `babel` option.
This package contain some pre-defined behaviours for selected languages with expection of polish language.
However in `Setting/LANG/polish.sty` there is included implementation of proper quotation for polish language.
To use quotation marking use the following command: `\enquote{ <Something to quote> }`.

###### Some dimensions
To modify width of corresponding fields, `timeitem`s go to `Settings/WidthSettings.sty`


### How to define own sections/fields?

There are defined some macro definitions, which can produce other macro, which produce the other macro.
Sounds complicated, but this is a very elegant way to define you own fields and sections.


###### Defining own section
To define new section in CV use `\DefineSection{ <section> }`.
This command will create:
1. macro `\<section>`, which is responsible for section placement;
2. macro `\<section>Icon`, which is responsible for selecting section icon. To change Icon just type `\def\<section>Icon{ <my new section icon> }`;
3. macro `\<section>Name`, which is responsible for section name output (see `Setting/LANG/...`).
If you didn't specify `\<section>Icon` or `\<section>Name`, no icon will be assigned to section and name will be the same as section `variable'. 
**Example**:
consider new field `memberships`:
```
\DeclareSection{memberships}
\ENG{\def\membershipsName{Memberships and organisations}} % or insert \def\membershipsName in
\PL{\def\membershipsName{Cz≈Çonek organizacji}}            % coresponding `Settings/LANG/file.sty`
\def\membershipsIcon{\faBank}
```

###### Defining own fields
Main idea behind `fields` is similar to `\author` or `\title` fields in standard *LaTeX* classes.
User can insert some text into `\author{ <name of the author> }` and then user can refer to it using `\@author` macro.
This is the way, in what `\DefineField` works, additionaly creating some icon macro.
**Example**:
Let's create `github` field.
```
\DefineField{github}
\def\githubName{GitHub}
\def\githubIcon{\faGithub}
```
Now user is able to fill this field:
```
\github{ <my github> }
```
To obtain the content of `github` field just refer to it with `@`:
```
\@github
```
There are two ways to add this field into `\makecontact` list.
One: treating field as general field `\ifnotemptyfield{github}` or one can specify it with `href` field using: `\ifnotemptyhref{github}{https://}`.
Href version has additional  `prefix` argument for hyperlink (like `tel:`, `http:`, for more see [Uniform Resoure Identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier)).
To add this field to contact section, one have to specify the order of the fields in `Settings/FillContactOrder.sty`:
```
\def\fillcontact{%
    \ifnotemptyfield{author}
    \ifnotemptyhref{phone}{tel:}
    \ifnotemptyhref{email}{mailto:}
    \ifnotemptyfield{address}
    \ifnotemptyhref{www}{https://}
    \ifnotemptyhref{github}{https://}
    \ifnotemptyfield{placeofbirth}
    \ifnotemptyfield{dateofbirth}
    \ifnotemptyfield{status}
}

```

### How to add other language?
In this example let's consider `german` language.
First, copy one of the file from `Setting/LANG/` directory and edit it to fullfill other language vocabulary.
Create `Setting/LANG/german.sty`.
Second, append `CV.cls` file: 
1. declare your other language  at the beggining of `CV.cls` file:
```
\DeclareOption{german}{
\PassOptionsToPackage{\CurrentOption}{babel}
}
```
2. pass the path of file containing default definitions of section names, etc.:
```
\def\@LANG#1{\iflanguage{#1}{\usepackage{Settings/LANG/#1}}{}}
\@LANG{polish}
\@LANG{english}
\@LANG{german}
```
3. for convinience declare toggle macro for your other language:
```
\def\GER#1{\iflanguage{german}{#1}{}}
```
That's it!
Now you are able to toggle between different languages everywhere in the document.
